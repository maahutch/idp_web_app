Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      US Census Bureau, TIGER metadata reports-

      "Accurate against Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS),
      FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes
      and base names.  The remaining attribute information has been
      examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy."

  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    US Census Bureau, TIGER metadata reports -

    "The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2)
    is compete for census purposes.  Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong
    to the "Geometry and Topology" (GT) class of objects in the "Spatial
    Data Transfer Standard" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are
    topologically valid.  Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain
    relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit
    requirements.  These requirements include:

    * Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.

    * Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.

    * Complete chains do not extend through nodes.

    * Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain
    element and are consistent throughout the extract process.

    * The chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps.

    The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical
    consistency and limits of files.  All polygons are tested for closure.
    The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update
    System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census
    TIGER data base.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for
    states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding
    spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for
    logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original
    Census TIGER data base files.  Most of the Codes themselves were provided
    to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining
    FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been
    fully tested for consistency."

  Completeness_Report:
    US Census Bureau, TIGER metadata Reports -

    "Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the
    Census TIGER data base at the time the TIGER/Line files (Census 2000
    version) were created."

  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        US Census Bureau, TIGER metadata reports -

        "The information present in these files is provided for the purposes
        of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates
        in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but
        the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as
        the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies
        with the source materials used, but generally the information is
        no better than the established national map Accuracy standards
        for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS);
        thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications
        such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses
        that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's
        surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy
        standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum,
        1983.  For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of
        most of the Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the
        1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding
        (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan
        areas, compare favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The
        Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of
        what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan
        areas.  The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that
        enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census
        TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature
        shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made
        other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local
        participants for Census Bureau programs.  The locational accuracy
        of these updates is of unknown quality.  In addition to the Federal,
        State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain
        information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared
        by private companies.  Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional
        accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-
        decimal place precision is useful when producing maps.  The precision
        allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed
        in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without
        overlap."

    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Vertical accuracy was not a factor in the digital production
        of the data set. No quantitative tests were performed.

      Process_Description:
        US Census Bureau, TIGER metadata reports-

        "In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER
        data base in a GIS or for other geographic applications, the
        Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of selected information
        from the Census TIGER data base, organized as topologically
        consistent networks.  Software (TIGER DB routines) written by
        the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census
        TIGER system data.  TIGER/Line files are extracted from the
        Census TIGER data base by county or statistical equivalent
        area.  Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical
        equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length
        record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either
        line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types.  The Census
        Bureau has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files
        since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature
        and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate
        updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous
        version." 

        "TIGER/Line files are created and processed in a VMS
        environment.  The environment consists of two Alpha Server
        8400s clustered together running OpenVMS version 6.2-1H3 used
        for production operations.  The Census TIGER system is driven
        by DEC Command language (DCL) procedures which invoke C
        software routines to extract selected geographic and cartographic
        information (TIGER/Line files) from the operational Census TIGER data base."
