  Description:
    Abstract:
      ZCTA_TIGER05_IN.SHP is a polygon shapefile that contains ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA's) for the state of Indiana.
      This data set has been updated using the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2005 TIGER/Line Files (First Edition), which contain
      updated ZCTA's reflecting U.S. Postal Service ZIP Code changes through October, 2002. There will be no further updates of
      ZCTA's until required for the 2010 Census.

      The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau
      pertaining to ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs):

      "ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs™) are a new statistical entity developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating summary
      statistics. ZCTAs are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas. They represent
      either USPS five- or three-digit ZIP Code areas. ZCTAs are created based on the following criteria:

      • ZCTAs follow census block boundaries. The ZCTA code for each census block generally represents the majority ZIP Code of the
      addresses within that census block.

      • ZCTAs are not exact representations of the USPS’s ZIP Code delivery areas.

      • ZCTA codes cover all land and water areas.

      • ZCTAs include some dedicated post office box ZIP Codes in areas served only by post office boxes.

      • ZCTAs representing post office box ZIP Codes generally have more than 10 addresses.

      • ZCTAs exclude unique, single delivery point ZIP Codes, such as those for firms and organizations.

      • ZCTAs are distinct from other Census Bureau statistical areas, such as census tracts, because they are
      not stable over time and are computer-delineated based on the location of addresses at the time of Census
      2000 rather than manually delineated by local program participants or Census Bureau staff before the census.

      • ZCTAs are distinct from other representations of ZIP Codes because they are based on address information
      and ZIP Codes collected or verified during Census 2000 operations.

      • ZCTAs frequently cross county and place boundaries and may occasionally cross from one state into another."

      For a more detailed discussion of how the U.S. Census Bureau created ZCTAs, please open one of the Adobe Acrobat
      files found at http://www.census.gov/geo/ZCTA/zcta.html

      The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ZCTA5_TIGER05_IN.SHP:

      "The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER
      database.  The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area
      based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries.  The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no
      overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data
      set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation.  The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments
      representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries.  The files contain information distributed over a series
      of record types for the spatial objects of a county.  There are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate
      points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.  Other geographic information contained in
      the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types,
      address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features,
      landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries."

    Purpose:
      To provide a GIS data layer of ZCTAs in Indiana.

      The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ZCTA5_TIGER05_IN.SHP:

      "In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other
      geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line files."

    Supplemental_Information:
      This data set was provided to personnel of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) by Indiana Department of Transportation, Business
      Information and Technology Systems, GIS Mapping personnel. The data set provided was in an ESRI shapefile format. This data set
      was provided to personnel of the IGS on September 13, 2006. Data is originally from U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census
      Bureau, Census 2005 TIGER/Line Files (First Edition).

      NOTE: The U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2005 TIGER/Line Files (First Edition) contain updated ZIP Code
      Tabulation Areas (ZCTA's) reflecting U.S. Postal Service ZIP Code changes through October, 2002. There will be no futher updates
      of ZCTA's until required for the 2010 Census.

      The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ZCTA5_TIGER05_IN.SHP:

      "The TIGER/Line data are not in a mapping projection even though most of the features were scanned directly from source maps that were in a
      projection.  To find out more about TIGER/Line files and other Census TIGER database derived data sets visit http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger.

      TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER database twice a year or when needed for geographic programs required to support the
      census and survey programs of the U.S. Census Bureau.  No changes or updates will be made to the 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files.  Future
      releases of TIGER/Line files will reflect updates made to the Census TIGER database and will be released under a version numbering system
      based on the month and year the data is extracted."

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ZCTA5_TIGER05_IN.SHP:

      "The TIGER/Line files contain data describing three major types of features/entities;

      Line Features -

      (1) Roads

      (2) Railroads

      (3) Hydrography

      (4) Miscellaneous transportation features and selected power lines and pipe lines

      (5) Legal (governmental unit) and statistical boundaries

      Landmark Features -

      (1) Point landmarks, e.g., schools and churches; sporadic coverage added on an as-needed basis

      (2) Area landmarks, e.g., Parks and cemeteries; sporadic coverage added on an as-needed basis

      Polygon features -

      (1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the Census 2000 census statistical data and governmental
      unit boundaries legally in effect as of the latest Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS)

      (2) Locations of area landmarks

      The line features and polygon information form the majority of data in the TIGER/Line files. Some of the data/attributes
      describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers (names), CFCCs (used to identify the most noticeable
      characteristic of a feature), address ranges, and geographic entity codes.

      The Census Bureau includes landmark features on an as-needed-basis and has made no attempt to ensure that all instances of
      a particular landmark feature were included. The TIGER/Line files contain point and area labels that describe landmark features
      and provide locational reference. Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label and feature Landmarks may overlap or refer to
      the same set of polygons.

      The Census TIGER database uses collections of spatial objects (points, lines, and polygons) to model or describe real-world
      geography. The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to represent features such as streets, rivers, and political
      boundaries and assigns attributes to these features to identify and describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market
      Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
